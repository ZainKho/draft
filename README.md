## Notes

### Requirements
This project utilizes UICollectionView to generate a list of trips for each user, utilizing SnapKit to organize elements on the screen. We use UINavigationBar to let users see their trip details. From the backend, we retrieve user information as well as integrate with the Unsplash API to get images from the trip's location. We use UserDefaults to keep the data persisting each time the user launches the app.

### Hack Challenge
